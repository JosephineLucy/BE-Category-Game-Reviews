## NC Games

Welcome!

I have built an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically.

This is the backend to my project: NC Games.

Have a go at this project yourself by followiing the instructions below!

## Connect to the Databases Locally

Clone this repository and run the command, npm install to install the dependancies needed.

## Create Enviroment Variables

Create the environment variables by creating two .env files:

.env.development
.env.test

In each file, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
